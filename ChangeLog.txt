Nov	 11	2005 - EagleEye	 - With the help of Rastaman, typemapped a lot of CEGUI data types properly.
Nov  12 2005 - Kanma	 - Did some minor changes to some interface files: 
						 - SharedPtr, MeshPtr, MaterialPtr and SkeletonPtr are now correctly working (their use is transparent, they act like a Mesh, Material and Skeleton) 
						 - Removed some warnings 
						 - Probably some other details
Nov	 21	2005 - Rastaman  - Added new headers files:
							ControllerFloatHandler.h
								allows a callback into c# code for ControllerValueFloat.SetValue/GetValue, i left ControllerFunctionFloatHandler in but i didn't get it to work correctly. it compiles ok.
							MeshBuilderHelper.h
								helps create manual meshes, see DemoGrass.
						 - Addednew interface files:
							ControllerFloatHandler.i
							MeshBuilderHelper.i
							OgreDataStream.i	//from Sinjaph in forums post just thought I would include it
							OgreHardwareIndexBuffer.i
							OgreIteratorWrappers.i
						 - the other interface files where changes I needed to make for the typemap changes.
						 - New DemoGrass in Samples folder
Nov  25 2005 - Rastaman  - Added interfaces for Overlay elements.
						 - Added template line in gpuprograms.i.
						 - Extended Ogre::Plane for a new constructor.
						 - ColorValue properties added. this may have been in an older update.
						 - update to DemoGrass, removed some test output. fixed SetIndex bug in function createGrassMesh.
